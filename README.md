# Physically-based Rendering

Rendering 3D scenes physically-based through Path Tracing. Interaction of light with surfaces is evaluated through bi-directional reflection distribution functions (BRDF). *â€” Master Thesis 2013/14*


## Vulkan branch

**Not in a working state.** All it shows currently is a ImGui window, but no model rendering is done.


## Acceleration structure: BVH

* Stackless traversal.
* 1 or 2 faces per leaf node.


## Requirements

* **OS:** Linux  
*Though it should be possible to build and run it on other platforms as well. I just never tried it.*
* **Hardware:** GPU with Vulkan capabilities  
*Tested only with NVIDIA.*
